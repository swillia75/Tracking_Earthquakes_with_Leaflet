# leaflet-challenge

The task is to retrieve earthquake data from the USGS website and plot it using leaflet. The 
data was ploted on a street map tile and was marked by colored circles showing increased magnitude by color change. Also, the 
circles were sized according to magnitude. The maps were uploaded to github. As a challenge, techtonic plate data was retrieved and 
ploted on the same map. A dark map layer and satellite layer was added with layer control. Both data sets were also controlled by layer
control. There appears to be correlation between plate boundaries and earthquakes. There also appears to be a correlation between plate boundaries 
and magnitude.
